# AAB
 This repository showcases my Python implementations of advanced algorithms  used in bioinformatics. These projects were developed during my "Bioninformatic Advanced Algorithms" course. 

📁 Structure

    assembly.py – Sequence assembly.
    auto_finito.py – Finite Automaton implementation.
    exaustivo.py – Exhaustive Motif Search.
    gibbs.py – Gibbs Sampling algorithm (Motifs).
    graph.py – Graph Algorithm.
    metabolic_networks.py – Graph for Metabolic Networks.
    tries.py – Tries Algorithm.

handwritten_tests/ – Manually written examples:
