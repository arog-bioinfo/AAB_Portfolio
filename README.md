# AAB
 This repository showcases my Python implementations of advanced algorithms  used in bioinformatics. These projects were developed during my "Bioninformatic Advanced Algorithms" course. 

📁 Structure

    Algorithms/ – Core algorithm implementations:

        BB.py – Branch and Bound algorithm.

        BWT.py – Burrows-Wheeler Transform.

        auto_finito.py – Finite Automaton implementation.

        exaustivo.py – Exhaustive search strategy.

        gibbs.py – Gibbs Sampling algorithm.

        tries.py – Trie data structure for string pattern matching.

    Notebooks:

        Part_1.ipynb – Checkpoint 1 

        Part_2.ipynb – Checkpoint 2

        radon_analysis.ipynb – Additional case study or project (e.g., radon data).

    unittestAAB.py – Unit tests for validating algorithm correctness.
